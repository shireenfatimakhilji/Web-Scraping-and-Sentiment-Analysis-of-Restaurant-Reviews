Tommy,New York City,34 reviews,I was with a party of 10 people. Many of them have eaten here before but it was my first time. Appetizers were good although a little small. I had a pasta dish that included some chicken and the chicken was way overcooked and hard so I was basically disappointed with my main course. I asked the others about their dishes and they weren’t blown away either.,4,4,5,4,Dined on November 24 2024

Gary,New York City,29 reviews,Yeah the food was OK typical little Italy red sauce place. The ambience was nice. Live music and an accordion player walking around. Not very Italian the south Spanish but not Italian. The biggest problem was accessibility. When I made the reservation I alerted them that I was in a large power wheelchair and asked to any accessibility. The only bathroom in the restaurant is down several steps flights of stairs. There was no accommodation for someone in the wheelchair. This made it very uncomfortable for me. I should have been informed when I made the reservation.,2,4,3,4,Dined on October 5 2024

Shelly,Indiana,4 reviews,The outdoor courtyard has a great ambiance. I recommend to sit there. Our waiter was not attentive at all had to wave him down to get anything. The man helping with water and such was awesome. He saw me trying to get little ice cubes from my water and ran over with a full glass of ice. He should be the waiter. For Little Italy we were not very impressed with the food.,3,3,2,4,Dined on September 29 2024

Chris,Seattle,15 reviews,I have been here 4 times in the past 20 years and have always loved the meals and service.  I even sat at an adjacent table to Jon Voight Michael Imperioli and Edie Falco which was a double treat!  Last night our meals were delicious.  Three of us had pasta dishes and I ordered the steak dinner which was delicious although I would have preferred a bed of polenta to rice with my steak.Frank was outstanding as our server and we all enjoyed a wonderful time once again.  Thank you for your hospitality.,4,4,5,4,Dined on September 21 2024
Mia,Greece,3 reviews,We had a lovely meal this evening .. the staff were friendly and although there was no children’s menu the chef kindly cooked our toddler spaghetti Bolognese that wasn’t even on the menu!

shawn,Miami,6 reviews,There are so many Italian restaurants on Mulberry Street that it's hard to know which ones are better than others.  Il Cortile came recommended by 2 serious Italian-American food lovers so we gave it a try and discovered why it was recommended.They served all of our Italian American favorites and each one was stellar: linguine alla vongole overflowing with fresh baby clams and chicken parmigiana and pasta fagioli as good as Grandma's.,5,5,5,5,Dined on September 2 2024
Roger,New York City,8 reviews,This was not our first visit and will definitely not be or last. We visit Il Cortile everytime we come into NYC. Today we were able to sit in the garden area for the first time. It was like we left NYC and ended up in a garden in Italy. Will definitely request the garden in the future.

OpenTable Diner,New York City,4 reviews,Made resies 2 weeks in advance.  Not surw why we pucked this place but i must have read about it somewhere… Our first table was right next to kitchen door.  Not what i want to look into when I dine.  Moved into the fake flowered dining court.  Cheesy!  Food - son had cheesy pizza … no sauce… it was good… or ok.  Daughter had stuffed gnocchi… nothing anyone suspected.  It was more like 4 big Raviolis but potato.  It was ok.  I had the seafood pasta… the seafood undercooked.  Husband had veal.  Very mediocre.

Unfortunately the service was average at best. We had to wait 30+ minutes after our reservation time to be seated.  Once seated the service was average and slow.

JohnnaM,New York City,65 reviews,We had a lovely meal on a recent Saturday night.  We arrived a few minutes before our 6:30 reservation and were seated right away in the garden area which was lovely.  It took quite a while for our server to come to the table and I was just about to ask someone who our server was but then once he came over everything went smoothly. It was a little odd that they were already out of one of the specials that was available but otherwise the food came out quickly and everything was great.  Our only complaint was that we felt like they were trying to turn the table as they quickly cleared plates etc.  They also had a photographer going around taking pictures at the tables so that was a little odd and we weren't interested.   We didn't order dessert (too full) and were in and out in about an hour.  Again the food was great and the staff were helpful.,4,4,3,4,Dined on February 19 2023

When we arrived at 7:30 pm the staff couldn’t find our reservations and when they did we were not seated until 8:10 pm but it was a very busy time in NYC due to the holiday season. After we were seated everything was beyond perfect. All the food was delicious our waiter was great and this restaurant made a get together with family a memorable event.

BK23,Palm Springs,60 reviews,Really a disappointing experience. I’ve loved Il Cortile for almost thirty years and have probably been there 25 times visiting from the west coast.Firstly we were seated in a lovely room but right next to a door to the outside where numerous customers were eating next to heaters in 37 degree weather.  The wait staff had to use this door whenever they served or cleared tables.  But numerous customers entered or exited through this door despite the fact they were supposed to use the primary door.  Anyway we were freezing for an hour whenever the door stayed open. Ultimately we were moved to another room.Secondly the chef is apparently a rigid arrogant man.  We wanted the veal scallopine with a pasta—it came with rice.  No substitutions were allowed.  Then we asked about the chicken Parmesan which came with penne and asked if we could have linguini or any other lighter pasta. Nope. Then I asked if I could buy a side of pasta. Nope—none on the menu and not allowed. We were with friends visiting NYC for the first time.  One is severely hearing impaired.  A band of six (3 trumpets trombone two drums) paraded through the restaurant for 45 minutes playing raucous music when all we wanted was a quiet dinner to enjoy good food and chat. It turned a beautifully decorated classy place into something very different enduring what sounded like a high school marching band.Manny the maitre’d or manager was wonderful in trying to accommodate us and comped us significantly.  At one point both he and our waiter said “new chef new rules.  Ownership should have a bigger say in the type of place they want to run. Our lasting impression is that there were too many issues to ever return given all the choices NY and Little Italy offer.,2,4,4,3,Dined on December 11 2022

Fedor6,Washington DC,31 reviews,Il Cortile is a fun restaurant with delicious entrees. HighlyWhat a fun and memorable dinner we had at Il Cortile! The atmosphere was festive for the holiday season and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the angell hair with bolognese. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the bolognese was absolutely amazing. Others in our party really enjoyed the penne a la vodka sauce and chicken parmesan. The portions are quite generous. The service was excellent as well.,4,5,5,4,Dined on December 4 2022
OpenTable Diner,New York City,1 review,"I made a reservation here for my boyfriends's birthday weekend in NYC. We had an 8:15 reservation on 12/3 for a large group made almost 2 months in advance. I arrived a little early  around 8pm so I wasn't expecting our table to be ready yet but I informed the lady out front we had arrived. We were ushered to the cocktail bar in the back where we waited for about 15 mins to be served but then they stopped serving since it was too crowded.After about 30 mins we went back to the lady outside to ask if our table was almost ready. She then stated she couldn't do much and that we needed to wait. She was extremely rude and unpleasant. After another 15 mins or so we went back up to inquire and were sent back to the same cocktail bar.It was just as packed and the bartender remembered us and felt badly we were still waiting. He was lovely and was the only good part of this place. We ended up leaving because we had been waiting almost an hour for them to set up our table which they kept saying was ""almost ready"".We ended up going to the pizza place next door which was delicious. So unfortunately but maybe fortunately I can't even comment on the food from Il Cortile since we didn't even get seated. Don't rely on a reservation go somewhere else if you actually want to be seated on time and have a good experience.",1,1,1,1,Dined on December 4 2022

TinaG,Columbus,28 reviews,I researched this Little Italy restaurant that had excellent reviews. I just don’t understand why. Perhaps we all ordered the wrong dishes. In my opinion the litmus test for an Italian restaurant is how well they do spaghetti and meatballs- the most basic and straightforward dish at any respectable Italian restaurant. The spaghetti and meatballs were so underwhelming. Seriously tasted like straight from a box. I haven’t been this disappointed in a restaurant in a very long time. I,2,1,2,4,Dined on November 24 2022

Scott,New York City,10 reviews,I’ve been to Il Cortile a number of times. The food is always good but we often have to wait even with a reservation. This past Saturday night was a horrible experience and will honestly make me think twice about returning. Had a reservation for 7 people (all friends from out of town) and had to wait 1 hour even with a reservation. We waited in the back room and had drinks most of which were awful. I spoke with the manager at least twice who apologized and said they would “take care of us” and pay for some of our appetizers. I just wanted to eat but this was a nice gesture. I told him that it was clear that they were not leaving enough time between seatings (there were many others waiting as well) and he said that the people at the table we were to get had been there since 5:00 pm (we had a 7:00 pm reservation). I find it hard to believe that the people were sitting for three hours and they had not pushed them along. The kicker came when we received the bill and nothing was taken care of. An oversight? I doubt it. I think he was just placating me the entire time. There are too many great restaurants in NY to have to endure this for a dinner.,2,4,1,4,Dined on September 4 2022

Hopefully we caught the restaurant on an off day. Regardless I will return and hopefully be able to raise the review.,3,5,2,3,Dined on August 21 2022
RandallC,Palm Springs,60 reviews,We had not been to Little Italy in over a decade and knew that it must be included in our daughters first trip to Manhattan. We selected Il Cortile based on the fact it truly represents classic Little Italy. They did not disappoint. The menu provided a well rounded offering of the classics supported by a realistic and friendly wine list. Our server and support crew were attentive and not intrusive. My 13 year old daughter loves Carbonara and even though it was not on the menu that night  they just made it happen. Only suggestion would be ditch the QR code menu.,4,4,5,4,Dined on August 21 2022

Cons:  There were 4 of us dining 2 of whom I was meeting for the first time.  As we sat down at our table a man with an accordion came over to “serenade” us.  It made conversation difficult and awkward - especially when meeting people for the first time (as I was).  The accordion player would not leave and continued to play louder until finally we gave him money to stop.  Throughout the course of the evening we saw him do this to others both inside and outside of the restaurant.  It was unclear whether or not he was an employee of the restaurant but regardless they should have asked him to go away if he was not.  It was a disruptive and awkward start to our evening.  For this reason I will not be returning.,3,3,4,2,Dined on June 6 2022

Courtney,New York City,1 review,I made a reservation online for 10 people a week in advance. I called the restaurant twice to confirm the reservation since this was a dinner to celebrate my birthday and I did not want anything to go wrong. The restaurant confirmed with me the time and party size. Upon arrival we were told that they double booked every table but said we would still be seated shortly. The reservation was for 8pm but we stood waiting for two hours to finally get seated. They misled us the entire time and left us with no other place to go since it was a Saturday night and we had a large party. There is no excuse for this. Although the food was good I will not be returning because the service is totally unreliable.,1,4,1,4,Dined on April 10 2022

OpenTable Diner,Manchester,6 reviews,Arrived a little late for table to be told it wasn’t ready anyway. Lady led us to the upstairs bar where we were told that we would be served a drink while the table came free. 30 minutes later there was no sign of a drink and the bar staff (clearly overwhelmed by numbers in an overcrowded bar area) were not for talking. We chatted to a few people and one couple said they had been waiting for a booking from 7.30 (now 8.45). So we left and had a lovely meal at Da Genaro just along the road. It looks such a lovely restaurant and the atmosphere sounded great. Such a shame having travelled from UK and booked in advance that they messed things up.,1,1,1,1,Dined on April 2 2022

FrankP,Charleston,3 reviews,the food was wonderful.  I had the soft shell crab franchese over linguini and it was exquisite.  The othe rmember of the party were equally impressed with their meals.  Service was good.  Our server was not overly intrusive but kept us comfortable.  The ambience and the noise however really detracted from the over all experience....tables were too close and every patron seemed to be outshouting every other patron and honestly when I spend 400 dollars for a lovely meal I dont want to hear them singing happy birthday to the patrons.  I can get that for 40 at TGIF.  In spite of my little quirks the food saved the day and i rated it a 5.,4,5,5,3,Dined on March 27 2022

AmandaR2389,Greater Boston,4 reviews,I scoured the reviews for days to pick the perfect restaurant in Little Italy. We got the chicken parm which was flavorless and pounded so thin all you tasted was breading. The vodka penne was bland and I added chicken for an additional $7 fee and it tasted like it was boiled with no seasoning. My husband ordered the Sunday sauce with sausage rib and rigatoni and that was delicious but only available in limited quantities on Sat and Sun. Cocktails and Sangria were really good too but for $30+ a plate we paid over $150 for 3 people before tip and left pretty disappointed. Ambiance is nice staff is great very kind and prompt but food was overall lackluster. Maybe an off night in the kitchen.,3,2,5,5,Dined on March 6 2022

There were seats available in the pretty area of the restaurant and I think we would have liked it a lot more if we had been there.

OpenTable Diner,Las Vegas,1 review,This was my wife and I’s 4th trip to NYC and every time we have tried a new spot in Little Italy. This was HANDS DOWN the best one thus far. I recommend getting there by 6 for dinner because it fills up quick but the noise level stayed quiet. We had a two top table next to a couple others but it wasn’t bad. We ordered a pitcher of the red sangria and split a Caesar salad to start. The house dressing was amazing and so were the sangrias. Our entrees were DIVINE. The pasta…SO FRESH….the sauce..IMPECCABLE. Don’t get me started on the house breadsticks either. Crunchy and delicious. Our server was fantastic and so were all of the back waiters. I am a fan of THE SOPRANOS as well and the whole ambiance was on point. Don’t miss this place in Little Italy. Just don’t. We don’t see this kind of charm in any restaurants where we live.,5,5,5,5,Dined on December 22 2021

WolfNJ,New York City,20 reviews,I've been coming to Il Cortile in December for nearly 10 years.  It's been a favorite.  This year it fell way short.  In fairness I would assume that the resturant is being impacted by the Covid situation.  However  the resturant was completely full last Friday when we arrived.  I had made our reservation over a month in advance and requested a specific location in the courtyard I called earlier in the day and was told that they would do everything they coud to oblige.  Upon arrivlal I was told that the owner had reserved the entire area and we coud sit outside.  The service was a huge drop off from the past  The food  quality /presentation was a shodow of the past and the portion sizes have shrunk.  Overall disapointing .  I entertain a group of intenational associates every December and Friday night is saved for Il Cortile.  We won't be back next year.,2,2,3,2,Dined on December 18 2021

Gilreign,Greater Boston,47 reviews,Wonderful meal!  Gathered with family and friends for a holiday get-together.  We were seated in the festively decorated sky-lit courtyard. Each of our cocktails was carefully prepared and our staff was attentive without rushing or hovering.  Our only disappointment with the meal was our decision to order antipasto.  While visually stunning and delicious they were not designed to be shared.  For nearly the price of an entree ($18) it contained a meager amount of food a slice of prosciutto 2 of salami a spoonful of roasted red peppers and mushrooms.  The mushrooms were especially tasty.  Our main meals did not disappoint.  We ordered a variety of dishes both red and white sauces and everyone was satisfied with their choices.  The sausage is especially flavorful and chicken parmesan is my husband's favorite.  Our top choice for Italian in New York City!,5,5,5,5,Dined on December 6 2021

I had mussels as a main course they were very over-cooked however the white wine sauce they were cooked in was very good.

KaylaG,New York City,1 review,I had a party of 17 for my birthday and all the wait staff at Il Cortile were so friendly and attentive. My boss sent cupcakes to the restaurant prior and they worked with her to setup dessert. They were very accommodating for 17 people which is hard to come by in NYC where large groups have to do pre fixe. The ambience is stellar - the back garden is gorgeous with the lighting and decor. I highly recommend!! Thank you to Il Cortile for making my birthday so special.,5,5,5,5,Dined on October 15 2021

OpenTable Diner,New York City,1 review,Restaurant was busy extremely loud with large parties. Food was mediocre after waiting over 1.5 hours for entrees. Our waiter went MIA! He finally came to our table and said food was coming shortly. Another half hour passed. The floor manager came by asking if we had been served we said we had not. Surprised he went back to the kitchen and food finally arrived. It was fair not great by any means. The manager offered to buy us a drink to make amends but after being there for 2 hours we were done! His explanation was that they were backed up in the kitchen. This is just another Little Italy mediocre restaurant. After a recommendation from our hotel conceierge I let him know of our experience.,2,3,1,1,Dined on October 3 2021

Dani,New York City,1 review,Went here Sunday night with high expectations. Made a reservation and was placed right by the server station which wasn’t a huge deal but less than ideal being that I went mainly for the back garden. We ordered the fried mozzarella to start and it looked and tasted like they threw cheese in between two pieces of white semi fried bread. I got the Sunday special and was very disappointed plus not to mention the hostess was less than friendly. I tried to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt being that they were prob overwhelmed with San Gennaro but sadly I would not go back. The only good thing we had that night was the plentiful sangria,1,1,1,3,Dined on September 27 2021

JeannineC,New York City,1 review,I have been going to this restaurant for well over 15 years and the food never disappoints!  I was talking to my waiter last night and he has been working there for about the same amount of time.  That tells you a lot they value their employees.  Anyhow the food drinks and ambiance is excellent!  I always enjoyed sitting in the atrium but now that there is outdoor seating I've been switching it up.  I highly recommend this Little Italy hotspot which has been there for a long time.  You will not be disappointed.  Can't wait to go again!,5,5,5,5,Dined on September 16 2021

ElanaJ,Indiana,24 reviews,"Il Cortile was mentioned in a few blogs and their menu offered several seafood dishes which was a win for me.  Everything was great including Fabricio our awesome server and the ambiance.  My husband's linguine cicale and my crab and lobster ravioli were perfect.  I admit the ricotta cheesecake was a little dry but tasty nonetheless.  The only criticism I would give is the hostess would not seat us in the lovely back patio because it was ""full"" yet proceeded to sit the next seven or eight tables in that section.  We sat in the main dining area next to the bar at a two-seater that felt like it was in the way of the servers.  Regardless overall the decor the food and the experience were worth it.",5,5,4,5,Dined on September 11 2021

The drinks were mediocre at best and the food was not good at all! Vegetarian choices are limited and they aren’t willing to make substitutions. My friends who ordered meat dishes also did not enjoy their meal. I usually also judge an Italian restaurant by the bread they serve - and this one was horrible! The bread was cold and stale and served with butter that came straight out of the fridge. Never again!,1,1,2,2,Dined on July 24 2021

Customer,Chicago,7 reviews,One of the worst restaurant experiences in our 20 years in nyc. The maître d' was beyond rude not only saying that he didn’t “pay attention” to our reservations but kept pointing at tables for 40 minutes saying “this will be yours” and giving it to people who had reservations after us. We were very polite and patient and every time we checked in with him for an update he kept saying “i don’t know how you made a reservation” and even when we showed him our open table confirmation he said “I don’t know how this happened I didn’t allow more reservations”. After 40 minutes we asked for a specific time update and he said “I don’t know” so we told him we felt poorly treated and we’d be going to another restaurant and his reply was “Thats good”. We’ve been to this restaurant a few times before but after this we won’t be returning.,1,1,1,1,Dined on September 12 2020

Decent,New York City,7 reviews,We had an 8:30 reservation on Valentine's Day. When we arrived there was a line out the door of people who also had reservations. They had clearly overbooked for the night. I have never seen anything like it before. They had all of us waiting in the back of the restaurant around this tiny bar. When we were told to go back there I saw at least 50 people already waiting. We waited for about an hour and then left as we had still not been seated. There were people there who had reservations at 7:30 and still hadn't been seated at 9. There was still a line going out of the door when we left. I couldn't even believe they were still lying to people telling them they would be seated. No apologies no offer of a complimentary drink for the inconvenience nothing. Luckily my boyfriend and I found a great restaurant down the street where we were seated within 10 minutes. I was told Il Cortile had great food and ambiance. It was pretty but I can't say anything about the food as we didn't get to eat. I would never go back to this restaurant because they clearly don't honor reservations. They also displayed a complete lack of professionalism and customer service. Overbooking to this extent shows greed on a level that was completely unacceptable. As it was Valentine's Day I'm sure the night was ruined for a number of couples. There are tons of great restaurants in Little Italy so try one of those and steer clear of Il Cortile.,2,3,1,4,Dined on February 15 2020

FooderG1990,New York City,3 reviews,Just not good quality food. The decor and ambiance is amazing but it doesn't make the most of the food. There's not one thing good about the food. Tasted very poorly too much salt cold...we had the antipasto which was one enough for maybe one person let alone to share....the fettuccini tasted like something out of a can and the lamb osso bucco was just a meal of salt with the mixed vegetables being a sauce of carrot crumbs.....nope theres better restaurants out there. I was shocked we went there on Valentine's Day and it almost ruined the whole night.,2,1,4,5,Dined on February 15 2020

Pumpkin,New York City,8 reviews,They cannot handle their  reservations.  We had a 7pm Rez for a party of 9.  When we walked in at 10 to 7 they asked us to wait a few minutes.   We then found out that there were 6 parties of 8 people still waiting!! Their reservations were 6:00.   The host was not telling people who walked in with reservations that they were incredibly behind.   No apologies no I am sorry just ride all the way around.  Even when I asked for an honest answer he wouldn’t respond.   We left ate next door at Casa Bella returned and our table was still not ready.  DO NOT EAT HERE,1,1,1,3,Dined on December 29 2019

BradD,Austin,18 reviews,The ambiance in the restaurant was pretty neat- although we were seated in an area that sort of connected two other larger/ nicer areas. So that was a little disappointing. My food was really good- my mom said her chicken was a little dry. The service was bad. We had a waiter who was non- existent during our meal. Never coming over to check on us. No bread was given to us up front. The person handling filling up the waters was more present throughout the meal and we even had a hard time getting him. They really need to look closely at their wait staff and their attention to their customers. The tip did reflect the bad service.,3,4,1,4,Dined on December 27 2019

Krista,New York City,1 review,We had our annual Christmas dinner at Il Cortile Sunday night with the women in my family - a table of 5. The restaurant was relatively empty. After taking our orders our waiter was no where to be found. The appetizers were ok but surely nothing to write home about. Our issue was primarily the dinner after our waiter did not return to our table another waiter came over and said he'd be handling our table even though our original waiter had taken on a larger party not far from us. My sister and my cousin both got the same dish which is the Linguine Cicale which is supposed to include Wide linguine with shrimp scallops calamari & mussels. The dish had no scallops no shrimp one muscle shell and the meat was missing inside of it. The dish was smothered in just calamari. Before they could say anything about it the 2nd waiter left our table never came to check on us the entire time we were eating so you couldn't say anything about the dish. The next time we saw someone it was the bus clearing the table. At $28 a dish the Il Cortile should be ashamed of what they served them. My mom's dinner at $20 was 4 ravioli in a plate. Overall relatively low value & terrible service for what we spent.,2,3,1,4,Dined on December 16 2019

Lovefood,New York City,18 reviews,We arrived and were told our table was not ready. We had 2 handicapped elderly people in the party.  We were asked to move to bar which required 2 sets of stairs. We were there about 3 minutes when we were told our table was ready which required us to navigate back through the starts to the front of the restaurant. Poor logistics on the hostess. Service was very spotty and our food came out in shifts which did not make for a great experience. 3 pasta dishes came out then 1  fish dish then 1 chicken dish and then a veal dish.  This was over a 15+ minute span. One person in our party was already done with their meal before the last meal even arrived. Our waiter was very nice but he clearly had too many large tables as we did not see him again until it was time to pay the bill.  The bus boy attempted to take away the last diners meal when he was not done just took it right out from under him. Food was good. Unfortunately the service made for a not so great experience.,3,3,2,3,Dined on December 1 2019
Vincent,New York City,60 reviews,Not what it was in the past when it was outstanding and one of the best Italian restaurants in NYC. Where do I start? Well how about the service which was practically non-existent. You had to wave down a waiter to get service. The top of our table moved and was not flat. After repeatedly telling waiters managers and bus boys no one fixed it. We were resigned to being very careful as to how we ate so as to not upend it. The food was mediocre at best not what it was in the past. When it finally arrived. The insalata tre colore had no vinegar in it just oil. The orders were all screwed up. My brother ordered rigatoni in vodka sauce and out came the rigatoni in fra diavolo sauce. We didn't say anything because it would have taken a half hour to get it replaced! Such a disappointment.

I RSVPd at least a week ago yet we were seated in the middle of the room so every drunk staggering by hit our table. I finally asked to be seated elsewhere. We moved to a corner near the trash can. Wow! We honestly didn’t know there was a festival that weekend so I’m sure it made things worse! Food was NOT what it used to be. Tasted like sauce from a jar. Chicken Marsala was bland. Our Caesar salads were good. The waiter did his best so can’t fault him given the volume of people rolling in & out. We were celebrating our anniversary. Next time we’ll save the cab fare & pick somewhere in Manhattan! Such a shame.,1,1,5,2,Dined on September 22 2019

However they worked with us and seated us outside after about 30 minutes. The ambiance was great during the Festival the service was good. Food was average.  I've had better Chicken Parm at Macaroni Grill. Pasta I tried was decent. One of our party that got the fish said it had turned and refused to eat it.

MarshaF,Washington DC,3 reviews,"My own experience aside I don't think I've seen people treated this poorly in any other restaurant I've ever been to. I understand San Gennaro is a busy time but I don't think that justifies the abandonment of human decency.  Understanding how busy this time of year can be I did the smart thing and made a reservation.  The meaning of the word ""reservation"" was another thing Il Cortile abandoned as I waited at the restaurant for over an hour as people with reservation times later than mine (or no reservation at all) were seated ahead of me.  I get that things like this you know bribes they happen but it seemed the only people being seated at all were people who scratched the host's back (both literally and figuratively). The weak-willed host was probably my biggest gripe with the restaurant.  The Napoleonic gentleman must've thought he was Saint Januarius the way he was wielding his perceived power.  Bribery is all well and good but the lack of integrity took a disappointing turn when tables were being awarded to female patrons who ingratiated the man's fragile ego with thinly veiled attempts at flirting.  Hope the guy found love that night.",1,1,1,1,Dined on September 15 2019

OpenTable Diner,Cincinnati,2 reviews,Let me start by saying the service was excellent but that is where the excellence ended. My mother and I had reservations and we needed an extra hour so they kindly extended our reservation. We got there and were warmly greeted and sat immediately outside. Our drink order was taken immediately and I should say the drinks were good. We ordered our food two pasta dishes and those came quickly not too quick but in a very timely fashion. This is where it goes down hill. My pasta was crunchynot al dente as I am a seasoned cook and know the difference it was also cold  it was terrible. My mother’s angel hair pasta was lumpy and mushy. The flavor was bland at best and I am being generous here. We LOVE authentic Italian food and cook it ourselves often sadly this was neither authentic or flavorful. I had to send mine back which I never do and asked for a simple Alfredo. The waiter was very accommodating and apologetic and brought me back the Alfredo. This was also terrible. The Alfredo tasted like it was out of a jar from the grocery store. I couldn’t eat it. My mother barely ate hers. The silver lining is that I chose to speak to the manager after I saw the bill  I sang the waiters praises as he was wonderful  but let the manager know how disappointing the meal was and it was not 80.00 worthy since we both had two bites and Sent mine back twice. He was also apologetic and made it right by comping our entire meal drinks as well. I did not expect that but I was pleased they did the right thing. I can’t say if this is a normal experience here others seemed happy with their food but I would think twice before going. We compensated the waiter as we would have anyway he was great.,2,1,5,5,Dined on August 24 2019

JoLeslie,New York City,3 reviews,We were in Manhattan on the hottest day of July. We were sat at a table right away and given water. The busboy saw that we were very hot and made sure that we had plenty of water to drink. Being that the temperature was in the high 90’s the a/c wasn’t doing it’s justice in keeping the restaurant cool. The server was very polite and friendly.  Good was great and fresh!   It was our second time to this restaurant and will return.Besides the a/c not working great all else was great.,4,4,5,4,Dined on July 21 2019

Nice,Los Angeles,109 reviews,This is one of the really authentic surviving restaurants inLittle Italy. The recipes are authentic and very well executed. I had been here many years ago and it was excellent then and it still is. A very friendly and highly efficient staff has your very need taken care of and the pacing from. First class kitchen is on the mark. We had the delightful pleasure of meeting Carmine the owner who spent several minutes speaking to us and insisted on buying us a drink a lovely gesture. It turns out he is a cousin of the owner of Carmine’s in West Los Angeles so we had lotsof things to talk about. Highly recommend everyone to head to Il Cortile for a truly great experience.,4,4,5,5,Dined on April 30 2019

Food was good.  I liked all the apps we tried (calamarifried mozerella stuffed mushrooms).  My pasta dish was exactly as expected.  One person had to send back under cooked sausage but otherwise 15 others had no problems.  Price was outstanding.  I just assumed with 16 people bill would be over $1000 (we had plenty of wine beer and mixed drinks) but was delightfully surprised that it was under $700 with gratuity.,4,4,4,4,Dined on April 21 2019

Restaurant was completely empty except for table that had group that walked in ahead of us without a reservation!  He was rude and would not seat us anywhere else.

The only criticism I could say about the restaurant is that we made a reservation online through OpenTable over a week ahead of our visit and when we arrived the hostess acted like we just walked off the street.   Also just a little difficult to get  a cab after dark on the streets of Little Italy/Chinatown...might recommend using Uber rather than a cab.

My friend thoroughly enjoyed the Farfalette (bow tie) pasta with chicken asparagus fresh tomatoes with a touch of cream.   At her request the chef omitted the speck ham from her dish.

One person said their ravioli tasted like chef boyardee another who had chicken pasta didnt finish it because they didn't like it and one dish had obviously canned mushrooms. This place may have been great one day since it has been open so long but for the prices and location there are tons of other better places especially in little italy. Personally mine wasn't terrible but it was more the level i would expect from a delivery italian place and not a sit down restaurant in little italy. Food is certainly not worth going back for but the service was quite good.,3,2,5,4,Dined on October 20 2018

OpenTable Diner,New York City,1 review,We made a reservation on Open Table and I did not receive a call to confirm so when I called they said they didn’t have it even though I provided the confirmation #. They figured it out and accommodated us as it was my mothers 70th but the entire experience was awful from start to finish. Service was the worst I have ever experienced in New York. We actually stood up 5 times to find the waitstaff before  during and after our meal. It took 45 min to take our order (and they were out of baked clams at 6PM) and 2 hours to receive our food. We had to pull plates and silverware off of other empty tables ourselves because no one even came back after we begged that someone take our dirty dinner plates 30 minutes after we all were clearly done eating. We just wanted to do the cake and get the hell out of there. It literally was awful all around. We asked specifically of the chicken cutlet was thin and which the waited confirmed it was and it was the thickest cutlet I’ve ever seen. It was he last day of San Generro festival which is the excuse the manager told us when we asked that they PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER AND BRING OUR FOOD after our 2 hour wait. Plenty of other restaurants in Little Italy - I’d stay away from this one if it’s a special occasion.,1,1,1,1,Dined on September 24 2018

JoLeslie,New York City,3 reviews,Great food!  Luckily we made reservations ahead of time.  It was the San Janero feast we didn't realize it when we came into town.  This restaurant among others had built extra outdoor seating during the feast to accommodate patrons.  Even with reservations the wait time was an hour for indoor seating.  We decided  we would eat outside as the wait was much shorter.  Being so busy service was good & food was better.  Next time we visit Little Italy we want to sit inside to enjoy the atmosphere in there.,3,3,3,2,Dined on September 23 2018

ShariS,New York City,2 reviews,Food was ok. Was much better the week before. We had a reservation at 7:30 and didn’t get seated until 8:00. The table we were seated at was available at 7:30 but they insisted the table was smaller than the one they wanted us to wait for. We insisted that it was the same size and asked to be seated there anyway. It was definitely fine for 8 ppl. Everyone’s dish was brought out at the same time—mine was 10 min later. Instead of the waiter apologizing he said it wasn’t his fault. It will definitely be a while before I decide to come back and give them another chance.,3,3,2,4,Dined on September 16 2018

NeilW,New York City,2 reviews,"il Cortile is a iconic spot in a shrinking NYC ""Little Italy"". Mulberry Street is converted into a pedestrian plaza on Summer weekends. That is a wonderful experience. Tourists like the sidewalk seating. Very nice when Mulberry is a pedestrian plaza. However the courtyard room is what il Cortille is all about.  The legend is that the glass roof in the courtyard room is bulletproof.  Excellent food with top shelf service not a legend.  My recommendation is the Sunday sauce. It is available only on Saturday and Sunday until it is gone.  Enjoy.",4,4,4,3,Dined on August 27 2018

They could accommodate us and the food was very good.This visit was a special occasion with my family and I reserved a table for 745 for 5 people.  We arrived at 750 and were told our table would be ready shortly.We had children with us and at that time they were hungry and needed to eat.  We waited in restaurant and checked back in 15 minutes and were told they were not ready yet.  They were going to send an appetizer in for the children but it never materalized.   We sat for dinner at 825 PM.  The dinner was fine but sullied by the poor performance with managing staff.  They made no attempt to appease us with a free drink or appy or anything at all.,3,5,1,5,Dined on August 26 2018

EileenD,Washington DC,1 review,We were in town with family from GA and FL.  We are from VA.  We had eaten here a year and a half ago with friends when we were visiting the city and enjoyed to food very much so we thought we'd go when we were in town again with other family members.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table even though we made a reservation weeks ago.  The food was excellent but the service was not.  It was terrible!  We got one round of drinks and then just water occasionally from the bus boy.  No other offers for drinks.  We saw the waiter when he took the dinner order and then dessert order.  That was it.  No waiter to bee seen.  We basically sat there for 15 or 20 minutes with empty plates when we were finished.  Finally they took the plates away and we had to ASK for the dessert menu.  We all ordered dessert (7 of us) and AGAIN we sat for another 20 minutes or so  for the waiter to come back.  Then sat awhile longer after the check was brought.  Not in a book or binder BTW...just the piece of paper with a pen.  Our entire party got up and went outside to wait thinking that might move him along.  Not very appealing.  We ended up with a bill over $450 with gratuity which was not an issue for good food but I expect MUCH better service.,3,5,2,4,Dined on May 27 2018

LisaL,Orlando,1 review,We were looking for a restaurant with good food but also quiet so we could have a conversation. We were with our cousins and niece and her husband. Il Cortile was the perfect place! We were warmly welcomed when we walked in and they thoughtfully had prepared a round table for 6 for us which was perfect. Our wait staff were friendly helpful and fun! They respected the fact we were all talking a mile a minute and let us be most of the time yet were attentive to our needs. The food was wonderful and everyone commented on how delicious the food was. The staff let us stay well past everyone had left and were just as warm and welcoming when we left as when we arrived. A fabulous place that we will revisit often.,5,4,5,5,Dined on February 25 2018

David,New York City,1 review,The food was very good but I’m not sure it merited the high cost.  Since we’re not very cost-conscious when we visit NYC that wasn’t the problem we had with Il Cortile.  What frustrated us was the extremely long wait between our appetizers and main course.  We’re generally patient diners but it took forever to get our meal.   Having watched other diners (who arrived well after we did) get their food we finally had to ask our waiter when our meal was coming.   They claimed it was but we still had to wait an additional 20 minutes.  Three of the four plates were simple pasta dishes and the fourth was a simple veal parmigiana.  I’m convinced they forgot our order.  In addition we assumed there were no specials at the restaurant but realized after we ordered that the other tables were offered several special plates.  (Strike two.). Strike three was when I ordered dessert they were out of the ricotta cheesecake. I then made a second choice that they were also out of.  Maybe if we had gotten our meals on time I would’ve gotten what I wanted!  I will not be returning to Il Cortile.,2,3,1,3,Dined on December 9 2017

WendyS,Denver,11 reviews,We were a group of 5 women visiting NYC for the weekend.  We wanted a nice meal in Little Italy and saw good reviews for this restaurant.  We made reservations.  When we got to Little Italy the street and area was mobbed due to a festival.  We had to wait quite a while for our reserved table.  They put us in the front room along with a party consisting of several families including several small children.  Through the entire evening the children were running in and out of the restaurant to the street and back in yelling and  screaming continuously.  Another table next to us was extremely loud and and laughing hysterically over their many bottles of wine.  We like to have fun too but we couldn't even hear each other talk.  On top of that we were pretty much forgotten by the staff - had to continually stop the waiters to ask for drinks for extra water and for the check.  Our food when it arrived was really quite good but the experience as a whole was pretty much miserable for us.,1,4,1,1,Dined on September 23 2017

I would like to go back.

Being frequent tourists to NYC whether with family or friends Il Cortile has not disappointed any of us.

OpenTable Diner,New York City,1 review,The food was delicious.  The only complaint we have is that my husband's dinner which was the pasta which (I think they called it Sunday sauce) was supposed to have a meatball a sausage and a bracciole. Well the bracciole was missing and when he asked the waiter he was told that it was in there. Clearly it wasn't and when the waiter asked the chef the chef said they were all out of it.  I'm thinking they left it out because they were out of it so telling my husband that they gave it to him when they did not was just not true. We wouldn't say it wasn't in there if it was! He actually ordered that particular dish because he was in the mood for bracciole!! Anyway other than that it was a nice evening.,5,4,5,5,Dined on May 22 2017

Greeneyedkzin,New York City,20 reviews,"I have been going to Il Cortile for almost 20 years now and it is probably my favorite place in Little Italy: traditional gracious and filled with tasty food served expertly and with warm hospitality.Even at 5:30 (we arrived early) the courtyard had filled with people I think were local and know a good thing when they have one. The place accommodated couples and families: even the children were composed and happy. Portions are huge. Two people can split an antipasto  while I don't know how anyone gets through antipasto pasta entree and dessert. I had the Sunday ""gravy"" which is tasty and more of a stew with meatballs sausage and ribs the flavor seeping into the rigatoni. Also ordered was veal and my friend couldn't finish that either. We barely had enough room for espresso and macchiato respectively.The manager and waiters are old-school and very courteous dinner was leisurely in beautiful surroundings. I'm already looking forward to going back.",5,5,5,5,Dined on April 24 2017

O.K. reasonable.....After 15 minutes passed we were told it would be twenty more.  Well not so happy!Then we were told after that twenty that it would be another 40 minutes!!!!At that point we left. We went across the street to a restaurant that was more than happy to have our business and seated us promptly.  There were many people there in our same position.  I think that they just kept taking reservations without even thinking of honoring them.  The host was very unfriendly about the entire situation.  Cannot comment on the food since we couldn't eat there.  The man at the front outside told us to wait at the bar and have a drink while waiting  and when we went inside we were told there was no bar! Major miscommunication? Had he never been in there? Very strange.  I have to say I have never been anywhere where the wait time expanded rather than going in the opposite direction.  Needless to say we will not be dining there anytime soon.,1,1,1,1,Dined on December 26 2016

The food service hospitality and ambiance of this place blew my expectations out of the water. The Ragu del Macellaio (Sunday Sauce) with Cavatelli was perfection right down to the fresh whole basil leaves. Each & every bite brought back memories of many past Christmas dinners with my family eating the exact same meal.Il Cortile will definitely be on my bucket list the next time I find myself in New York.

JosephP,Philadelphia,8 reviews,"My party and I ate at Il Cortile about a week before Christmas.  The other members of the party had been here before and go here whenever they are in Lower Manhattan.  However the meal left me wondering why anyone would forego patronizing the countless  Italian restaurants in the city to eat here.  The service was fine although the process of paying the check took a bit longer than it should have.  The restaurant tries to capture dining ""al fresco"" with the indoor plants and the ceiling window.  However it seems a bit dated and bit cramped.  The food was disappointing.  The Asiago Stuffed Mushrooms were fine and easily the best thing served to us.  The Caesar Salad was noticeably overdressed.  The dressing practically acted as an adhesive sticking the various leaves of Romaine together.  The flavor wasn't terrible the unpleasing texture and balance rendered it unappetizing.  The Linguini Cicale was poorly executed.  The scallops and shrimp were cooked well.  However the calamari which overwhelmed the dish due it being over portioned was rubbery and flavorless (as was the pasta).  The flavor ended up on the bottom of the bowl since it clearly wasn't tossed with the pasta prior to plating.  Overall the restaurant isn't horrible.  There are just many better places in NYC (and Little Italy) from which to choose).",3,2,4,3,Dined on December 20 2016

OpenTable Diner,New York City,2 reviews,Food quality and size of the menu are very good there's probably better food in the city but the value for the price is excellent. There are plenty of the standards and a few playful dishes as well. My girlfriend wanted Veal francese which was not on the menu but they immediately obliged us after we asked if it could be made. The portion sizes were very large for her dish and mine was adequate. The quality of the food itself was excellent for the price range. They have an amazing dessert menu with Bombas Cannolis and Tiramisu and many others. The interior is wonderful we had a lunch date in the garden room which is very comfortable and beautiful with the plants and light cascading down from the skylight. There are many other rooms and each looks well appointed and interesting there is also a small outside area if you desire to people watch or enjoy the view of little Italy. The staff were amazing behaving as a first class staff despite the less expensive nature of the restaurant. It's a bunch of mostly Italian guys consummate professionals. They are unobtrusive and allow you the time to enjoy your meal. Overall a wonderful experience.,5,5,5,5,Dined on October 2 2016

There was a very reasonably priced lunch menu posted on their posts outside but when we sat down the guy standing outside pushing people to eat at their restaurant handed us their dinner menu although it was about 2:10 in the afternoon and the lunch special ran till 4:00.  Upon seeing our confusion while reading the dinner menu he came over and asked us if we would rather see the lunch menus.  Seemed to us like they try and pull a fast one when they can.

david,Cleveland,22 reviews,To be fair to Il Cortile there was a street fair going on that we were unaware of at the time we booked our reservation.  The street fair took up the entire Mulberry street (countless blocks).  it took us an additional half hour to get to the restaurant as the taxi couldn't even get close.They had a limited menu and a limited wine list for the evening (and very inflated prices).  I had asked the manager if we could have the regular wine list and he said no they were only offering the limited list.  I figured this was because they had a bottle of Amarone listed at $175.  I looked it up and could get it from a wine shop for $48.  This kind of put me in a bad mood.  Anyway back to the food.  The manager waited on us.  We had a couple apps and they were pretty good. Stuffed mushrooms and calamari.  The apps came out pretty fast and were pretty good.  our entrees were ok too.  I had a stuffed filet.  It wasn't stuffed.  The cheese stuffing was just placed on top.  The steak was a bit under cooked but as they were slammed and it took an hour to get our entrees I didn't send it back (or ask to have it heated up as the sauce was room temp).  Every one seemed to enjoy their meals so i was the odd one out.  One of our friends had been there 3 weeks prior and raved about it so it really must have been due to the festival.We will give them another try (and make sure there isn't going to be a special menu or a festival going on).,3,4,2,3,Dined on September 18 2016

BarbM,Washington DC,6 reviews,We booked Il Cortile for a family celebration in honor of my father's 80th birthday.    It was hard to choose a restaurant since my family is Italian and my father is a wonderful Italian chef himself - so the pressure was on to find a place that would impress him.   As it turned out Vincenzo and his staff did not disappoint!  Upon hearing both my parents and my aunt and uncle compliment the Ragu del Macellaio I know we had chosen well. That's saying something since we have grown up with some pretty fantastic Ragu recipes in the family! The entire meal was delicious - starting with the family style appetizers pasta for the next course followed by some chicken and veal scallopine and then Vincenzo's amazing gelatto for dessert.  I especially appreciated Vincenzo's suggestions and advice on the food choices.  Overall we had three generations of family who all agreed that the experience was wonderful and I would highly recommend Il Cortile for good authentic Italian food.,5,5,5,4,Dined on August 14 2016

ElisaT,Phoenix,1 review,I was very disappointed with our evening at Il Cortile. I had asked for a courtyard table remembering (last time I've been in was 1975-76) that the courtyard was beautiful with brick facades and excellent floral touches everywhere. Instead it looked like it was under construction and a lot of the brick had been covered up.It seems like there has been at least one change of ownership since then because they did not take pride at all in the way the meal was served. We had brought a bottle of wine with us thinking we could open it with a corkage fee but when we found out the fee was $50 it was clear they wanted to send us a strong message. The food was average and we were parked next to a table of about 15-20 people where we couldn't even hear each other talk!Never again. Clearly they don't care about anyone's dining experience here.,1,1,1,1,Dined on July 4 2016

It was charged to my credit card without asking. After complaining the operation was supposedly reversed. I will be checking my credit card Billing account to make sure. Nothing special about this overrated restaurant. This reccomendation should be revised completely. The house wine was very bad.Alberto Miani.,1,2,2,1,Dined on December 31 2015

Luis,New York City,317 reviews,The food except for one dish (which was served with under-cooked pasta) was outstanding. The service was pleasant but spotty. Entrees did not all arrive at the same time (last plate served 15 minutes after the first!). Server apologized but the same happened with desserts. I was done with my coffee by the time my dessert arrived. Again great food (despite the one-dish mishap) but not sure worth trying again. Several other near-by restaurants have it all figured out. Very big shame because we did love the food! Management overall is poor.,3,4,2,4,Dined on December 27 2015

Zee1,New York City,25 reviews,We were a group of 20 people celebrating my daughter's 30th birthday.  Overall our experience at Il Cortile was good but not excellent.  Upon arrival we were made to wait about 30 minutes prior to being seated although the 7:45pm reservation had been made way in advance. Most of the food was very good but there were a couple of pasta dishes that were sub-par...the pasta was extremely under cooked rather than  al dente.  The pasta was crunchy and difficult to chew.  Our group also ordered a cake which was overpriced and somewhat dry not moist at all.While the wait staff was courteous they seemed to be understaffed and at times the wait to request additional water or drinks was exceptionally long.  Trying to get our check at the end of the evening also took an exceptionally long time.  Although we were seated a bit later than our reservation the staff seemed anxious for our group to leave the restaurant by 10:00pm.  We closed our bill and left at approximately 10:20pm.,3,4,3,3,Dined on September 13 2015

OpenTable Diner,New York City,4 reviews,I really wanted to like Il Cortile. It's in an iconic albeit increasingly touristy neighborhood in Manhattan but at the end of the meal it just didn't get me there. The decor really has not held up over time and it's left the place feeling chintzy. The food was really just okay and made me think that O could have made those meals just as well at home. I go to a restaurant like that to get a unique warmth of preparation that just wasn't there. The service was quite excellent and attentive though it may have been due to the fact that we were the only ones there.As much as it pains me to say it if you want that family feel in dining go to Carmines. If you want to be dazzled and enriched by delicate Italian cooking go to Gennaro. If you must get the authentic Little Italy experience Il Piccolo Bufalo is probably your best bet. Because unfortunately Il Cortile just doesn't have it anymore,3,3,4,2,Dined on July 16 2015

OpenTable Diner,Philadelphia,3 reviews,"My husband & I joined another couple on Saturday night for dinner at Il Cortile.  I made ressies well in advance through Open Table yet when we arrived they couldn't find our reservation on the list...finally after telling me we didn't have reservations the young man at the door asked if I booked though Open Table. I said yes and after checking on line found our reservations.  We were seated immediately at a table right near the front door (it was 20f that evening) and in front of the closet where they keep the red wine.  Our friend had to put her coat back on because she was so cold and my chair was bumped no less than 30 times during the meal as wait staff attempted to get into the wine closet.  What fun. The service was lacking from the word go...no wine list after a 15 minute wait a waiter appeared slowly followed by a wine list.  We ordered wine and dinner had to chase a manager to get a second bottle of wine to rectify a wrong starter and more.  Our waiter was MIA for the majority of our stay.  The husbands enjoyed their meals far more than the wives did! I went ""safe"" and ordered chicken parm and the red sauce was cloying and unappealing.  I ate only a few bites of my meal and the only question that was directed at me and my plate was do you want that wrapped? No concern that I didn't enjoy my meal at all.  That being said the entire experience from our welcome to leaving spoke volumes that the management team didn't care if I enjoyed my visit.  If they can rest on their laurels and regulars? Good luck to them. I will not be one of them nor will our friends/family.",2,2,2,2,Dined on February 15 2015

The menu is presented as a closed letter  which makes for a unique clean way to start the meal. A number of places opened 30 - 40 years sometimes present menu's that look like they were made from the first day they were opened. I ordered the fettuccine di parma- homemade noodles with sweet sausage which was excellent.The rest of my party experienced their Pollo line - Chicken Marsala Francese and Parmigiana . They were enjoyed be all. portions were plentiful. Service was professional.  With so many places to choose in this area you can't go wrong with I'l Cortile.

Yudhi,New York City,3 reviews,We were travelling from Australia and wanted to find a resturant that were able to cater for 11 guests located in little Italy.  Used opentable and this resturant came up as an option.It was easy to book and cater for 11.Large open areas to allow eating for large groups.  We were catching up with some of my family that lives in NYC.  There were 5 adults and 6 kids ( age ranging from 5 - 13 years old).Typical italian food and it was all delicious.,4,3,3,3,Dined on January 2 2015
Peruna66,Dallas,2 reviews,Every time we visit New York we make a point to have one meal at Il Cortile Restaurant.  This trip we made TWO visits!!  Each time the food the wine and the service was simply outstanding.  The stuffed shrimp with spinach was delicious as was the veal marsala.  Il Cortile is the true gem of Little Italy especially with its covered courtyard...a nice place for a romantic dinner.  However it IS a popular spot so be sure and make reservations for dinner.  Two thumbs up!!,5,5,5,5,Dined on December 30 2014

Strattonknows,New York City,1 review,Some of the restaurants in Little Italy have forgotten that it is food not personality thatkeeps people coming back. The sauces are fresh the cheeses are phenomenal and the seafood can't be beat. So its your traditional southern italian menu done exactly the way mom would have made it. You are made to feel special as waiters talk to you from across a crowded room. Salvatore our waiter was particularly good at creating a warmth that makes everything taste better and the wine recommendations were spot on--and argued about between wait staff and maitre'd  Go now.,5,5,5,5,Dined on December 26 2014

MDante,Tampa,136 reviews,I knew Little Italy was a tourist trap but a friend was in from Seattle and I read a review in the NY Times that said this place was good.  Absolute chaos.  We had a reservation but it mattered little and were forced to wait 20 minutes or more past our time.  Eventually they sit us near the door where it is opened constantly and was freezing outside.  Took forever to get each item and get our check.  They forgot to give us the appetizer entirely.  The food was average and the waiter was borderline rude.  I would never go back.  On top of it all it's not cheap and it should be!,2,3,2,2,Dined on December 21 2014

DineOutOften,Chicago,4 reviews,Enjoyed lunch on a Saturday with my wife and a friend. It was our first time so we didn't know what to expect but went based on reviews. Turned out to be a solid pick. The décor is old school Italian perhaps a bit outdated. My guests enjoyed a couple of different pastas with bolognese sauce and reported it to be very good. I had the veal scaloppini piccata and it was excellent. Service was a little slow but our server was overall competent and pleasant. The lunch menu appears to be the same that they use for dinner so it was a little pricey for a lunch spot in Little Italy. Overall a good experience. I would return.,3,4,3,3,Dined on December 6 2014

yanksansky,Orlando,35 reviews,The place is exactly as I remember it. The manager took us to the back of the restaurant to relax after a long day of walking through the 9/11 Museum. They had the nicest bartender serve up drinks in a cozy private area where we could talk quietly about our day. Then we were off to our table in the main dining area...warm breads were served with olive oil and butter. We had a wonderful server Fabrizio.  Singing at tables is customary as we viewed an extensive menu. I ordered a simple dish of linguine and white clam sauce others ordered the bolognese and pasta fagiole soups with broccoli rabe  all were excellent. great day and experience,5,4,5,5,Dined on November 30 2014

SarahF,New York City,11 reviews,Dined here for my husband's birthday while in NYC for the weekend.  The long cab ride from Times Square to Little Italy (in trafffic) was worth the wait!  Would come here again every trip to NY!  Kids were wih us and they loved it too.   Specials were unique and delicious.  My daughter had lobster ravioli my son fettucini alfredo with shrimp.  I had the traditional chicken parm and my husband a unique seafood special.  All amazing.  In fact everything (bread wine appetizers dinner) was delicious.

kjb27flw,Los Angeles,14 reviews,"Great atmosphere and attentive staff but bad food is bad food.  My ""stuffed"" shrimp was not stuffed but sitting among a pile of mushrooms peppers and gorgonzola cheese - totally overcooked.  The meat ravioli totally unforgettable.  The calamari flavorless - but the marinara sauce was great.  When I left most of my shrimp dish untouched and the server asked how it was - I told him.  The manager brought over a complimentary dessert.  It was a white cake with fruit in it - melon.   It was not good - the bottom layer totally dry (and it didn't taste good).  We were looking for an authentic Italian meal and boy were we disappointed.",1,1,4,4,Dined on November 17 2014

We have noticed that the portion sizes have increased over the years and the ambiance is not as good as it used to be.

Susan,New York City,66 reviews,There are many restaurants up and down Mulberry Street but they are not all created equal.  Resist the urge to wander into the first restaurant that looks good and steer yourself to Il Cortile where the food is out of this world. There is a lovely dining patio out front but if you wish a quieter setting ask to be seated in the garden atrium.  Full of character and quiet.  Service is outstanding....ice water and a big bread basket appear instantly and the menu is printed on a gold-sealed folded paper.  We were a party of four and each dish was excellent.  The veal dishes were creatively prepared and were the best we had ever eaten.  Interesting wine selection and an array of yummy deserts.

We were greeted warmly and given a lovely table underneath a skylight.  The menu is extensive filled with wonderful Italian fare all of it deliciously fresh.  Our server Frank was just the right balance of speed courtesy and helpfulness.  The rest of the waitstaff was also courteous and efficient.

I remembered a sun-filled atrium greenery marble statues bricks and bright color and chose Il Cortile on Mulberry Street..  The cousins arrived late but the waitstaff was very cordial while we waited.  To keep cool we ate inside with an outside view and ordered iced tea.  The bread refills were free not so the tea.  I erred with the gamberi fantasia (jumbo shrimp stuffed and wrapped).  My husband said the shrimp scampi was only okay however the cousins enjoyed several of the appetizers as lunch. Italian is not my favorite cuisine and to me the food did not measure up to the décor and service however my cousins had a wonderful time and that’s what counts.,3,3,4,5,Dined on September 2 2014

This whole street was a little too touristy. Go a street or two over and the food is much better.

Jeffrey,West Palm Beach,99 reviews,For a bustling Saturday evening in early August on Mulberry Street Il Cortile was quieter than most of the other places along the strip. Our olive oil was old with a bitter taste. The waiter happily gave us a fresher replacement but in very little quantity. The manager thought it necessary to come over to our table and admonish us for this ask and I put in gently yet firmly in his place. He picked a fight with me which was so unnecessary and unprofessional. The food was wine but not special and there were 9 of us who felt the same way. Mediocre wine was overpriced.

The sidewalk tables overlooking the sideshow of Mulberry street) are the best place to sit on a nice summer evening. But our group was too big so we had to go inside where maybe the lights are a little too bright and the ambience not so rustic . Still a great relaxing place to eat though.

First we waited about 1/2 hour for a waiter to come by.One person in our group ordered 2 appetizers as an entree. One of them came out with her salad. She sent it back until the right time. Eventually when we were done with our salads they brought the same dish back out - eggplant rollatini - mushed down and browned on top from being re-heated (poorly). My husband's dinner came out with that - scallops - which he loved. My dinner came out about 25 minutes later when they were done. It was pasta with pesto. I asked for shrimp with it - 5 or 6 overcooked tough shrimp.  The 4th person in our party ate about 30 minutes after I got my dinner.,1,2,1,4,Dined on July 13 2014

We were warmly greeted upon our arrival.  The waiter Angelo was extremely experienced attentive and helpful. The food was amazing the service was impeccible and pricing was affordable.

MicheleF,Philadelphia,84 reviews,Picked this restaurant based on reviews and Zagat rating. It was good nothing too spectacular. The rigatoni were cooked perfectly al dente which is the way I like them.  Meatball appetizer (yes one meatball but it was huge!) was good but a little bland.  Service was very good and the house red wine was great.  I really wasn't too impressed with the place - there's so many other places to try for Italian food.,3,3,4,4,Dined on April 26 2014

Patty,New York City,6 reviews,We thoroughly enjoyed Il Cortile. We were seated in the outdoor dining space in the back with glass enclosure up above. Also the table we sat at was the table James Gandolfini sat at. The food was very good. Only down part of our dining experience was our waiter. He was completely unsatisfactory. He was unfriendly and totally ignored us after taking our dinner order. He brought our dinner and never returned to our table again! We had to ask a waiter from another station of tables to get our bill for us. Not good. But we would go back and just be sure not to get this same waiter!,4,4,1,4,Dined on April 14 2014

Sanojmon,Philadelphia,10 reviews,We wanted some Italian so of course we decided to visit Little Italy in NYC.1) Parking - It's New York. Find it anywhere you can.2) Ambience - Awesome. It wasn't overwhelming and you could have a conversation at a normal tone and not feel out of place. You felt like you had plenty of room. Very nice old school feel as well lot of character to the place.3) Food - Great! Plenty of food for whatever you are looking for. Everyone in our party picked a winner. The wine list wasn't extensive but they had something for everyone. And they were all great choices.4) Service - Perfect. Even had a slight issue with one dish. Total class. They took care of it quickly and dropped another glass of wine to make up for it.You want to go here.,4,4,4,4,Dined on March 16 2014

QueenVillage,Philadelphia,3 reviews,We dined here for Valentine's Day. They were grossly overbooked for the number of tables they have. We arrived on time for our reservation to find more than a dozen people waiting ahead of us some waiting more than an hour past their own reserved times. We waited 30 minutes and were then seated in a hallway at a 2x2 foot table in the corner with chairs facing the wall with my chair up against an ice cold water pipe. The maitre d' was obviously stressed but unprofessional in his handling of the situation. When my fiancé complained about the table he was crass and suggested either leaving or waiting indefinitely for another table to open. Ultimately we were moved and the rest of the dining was good on par with others in Little Italy.,2,3,1,3,Dined on February 15 2014
amandah,Charleston,3 reviews,We were in NY for a couple days and just so happened to be there for Valentines Day and wanted a nice little Italian dinnerThis definitely hit the spot! Igot the Veal Piccata which was ah-mazing my husband got some sort of stuffed chicken he couldn't put his fork down. The wine was lovely dinner and calamari app were delicious and we had the special dessert.The one thing I would warn people about is the table arrangements. The tables are set up just like your usual European restaurant-the tables are close together and they make sure to fill every space. We didn't mind and I'm quite used to that but I could tell by another time that was sat next to us they weren't happy. We loved this restaurant and will def go back for our next NY trip.,5,5,5,4,Dined on February 15 2014
vday,Baltimore,1 review,The menu is perfect for picky eaters because they have just about every type of pasta and meat/seafood. The service on Valentine's Day was great--the servers and bus boys were attentive to orders and requests. The place itself got packed as the evening went on (as it should have on a special day) but it didn't get too loud that I couldn't hear my date so I suppose you can say the acoustics of the rooms are good. However I would suggest that they spice up the decorations of the rooms other than the main/garden room. Imagine going early to your reservation seeing that the place is still pretty much empty and hoping that you'd dine at the wonderful garden room but then getting seated in their side room away from the romantic ambience.,3,3,4,3,Dined on February 15 2014

Kidoctr,Oklahoma City,29 reviews,"Our experience was poor for only one reason. We had lunch on a Friday and were seated immediately. The restaurant is very nice - lots of food choices. The problem was my good friend's LIFE THREATENING tree nut allergy. She spoke with the waiter to let him know about her tree nut allergy. He replied by saying ""What's that""? She explained what a tree nut was. There didn't seem to be a problem and she enjoyed her food safely but after her entree was served the waiter came by and said ""I made sure they put extra walnuts in that"". That was COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE. The last time my friend was inadvertantly exposed to tree nuts she went to the ICU and spent 3 days in the hospital. A severe food allergy is nothing to joke about.",1,3,1,5,Dined on January 31 2014

The only plate of food that we got that I thought was not good at all was the chicken parmigianna. I don't recommend getting this the chicken was dry and the breading did not have a good taste.

DahliaDoo,Greater Boston,51 reviews,Being Italians and great cooks ourselves we are extremely picky about our Italian Restaurants. Il Cortile more than met our expectations. The pork chops with sweet peppers was OUTSTANDING . The Sunday Sauce special (braciole meatballs and sausage and rigatoni) brought us back to Nana's house. Caesar salad exceptional. Our service was attentive but not effusive We would definitely go back.

ILoveNY321,New York City,1 review,Went here on a Sat night with a group of 6. They don't sit you till all in the party is present but they have a nice waiting space upstairs. We appreciated that especially since it was the San Gennero Feast. Our waiter was ok. He never came to see if we needed refills in our drinks and if we needed something we had to track him down. Perhaps he was over worked and if so may have had to do with the feast. But the inside customers should still have great service with a fair going on outside. Inside prices were the same as any other day so perhaps extra wait staff on a busy weekend should be an option. I had international guests with us and their food was tasty their dining experience just ok.,3,4,3,4,Dined on September 22 2013

The service was horrible with a waiter that just drops and slams dishes and plates on the table like your at a truck stop or something. We ask for the manager who just started to argue with us and just walked away mid-sentance. They blamed the wait on a stuffed chicken dish that takes 25 min to cook. So I asked why did it take over an hour after appetizers for the mains to come out? By the way the chicken was as dry as a bone. Ugh,1,1,1,2,Dined on September 22 2013

My wife had a pasta dish with a garlic sauce which was okay but the sauce too watery for her taste. I had a shrimp dish with prosciutto and pignole nuts with a creamy garlic sauce that was superb. The total bill was a little over $100 but half of that was for the wine. For New York City the cost was reasonable.,4,4,4,4,Dined on September 21 2013

The waiter was no where to be seen. We informed the host who was talking to a customer at the next table from us. he seemed rather annoyed that we were asking him to check on our meal. Five minutes later our meal arrived. The food was very good once it all came.,2,4,1,2,Dined on May 27 2013

OpenTable Diner,New Orleans,3 reviews,I have not been to Il Cortile in about 10 years and was surprised at how casual it has become. There are no tablecloths on very old tables... They fold napkins and use them as pseudo placemats. The service started out fine but as the meal continued and the restaurant filled up it became clear they were under staffed and service was slow. The menu was very awkward because it was a huge piece of paper folded into 8ths and was difficult to follow. Food was great as always but I would try somewhere else next time. Too bad because this was one of my Little Italy favorites.,3,5,2,2,Dined on April 22 2013
Suzamcq,Cleveland,42 reviews,We've been coming here for years each time we visit NY. The food is amazing! My husband had the veal chop special and said it was THE best veal chop he's ever had. The pasta is always fresh and simply wonderful. I had the chicken marsala this time w/a side of pasta. Can't beat the food. All of the folks are super friendly....our main waiter this time was below par but we won't hold it against the resto. He must have been having an off night as service is usually great.,4,5,3,3,Dined on March 31 2013

LizM,Greater Boston,8 reviews,We had high hopes for Il Cortile based on the reviews and we did find it to be friendly warm and the food to be tasty. However we were one of 3 tables at 7:30 p.m. so we would have expected a little flexibility. 2 of our 3 diners had some food restrictions/requests and the waiter was not willing to accomodate them or even ask the kitchen. The $17 seafood salad paled in comparison to what we've had at similar venues. The chicken marsala was tasty but didn't come with a side of pasta or potato- and there wasn't an option to add one. The food was good- the atmosphere is odd. While the glass enclosure is quite pretty the abundance of fake plants is not.,3,3,3,3,Dined on January 31 2013

I ordered the chicken scarpariello and he wrinkled his nose and said ""that will take 45 minutes."" Not being in a particular rush I said fine and we ordered a bunch of appetizers (which are always small and expensive but we needed to kill some time). We weren't even done with all the appetizers before the food came out. Well most of the food - my son had to wait for his risotto.

The sauce had absolutely no taste. At first I thought it was me but my girlfriend had the same thought. Nothing seemed to have any tasteand I'm not sure why. Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing.

Since the food was delicious we decided to go back for dinner at another time. The food was still delicious but we were very disappointed that: a) we had to pay $8 extra to get a side dish of pasta (the Chef would NOT make substitutions) b) we could not get a glass of Pinot Noir and c) we could not get regular coffee (only cappucino or expresso). We left without having our long-anticipated dessert. With so many wonderful Italian restaurants in NYC to choose from we will not return to Il Cortile.,2,5,4,4,Dined on August 18 2012

It's striking how with the red sauces each have it's own distinct taste apart from each other. Portions are big good for sharing.

SaraF,New York City,4 reviews,Il Cortile was my Dad's favorite for years. As such I reserved a table in honor of father's day. Unfortunately the restaurant is no longer as extraordinary as we fondly remember it. The meal started off with a verbal offering of white wines including only pinot grigio or chardonnay. The chard tasted like a watered down sauv blanc. Trying the pinot grigio thereafter that option tasted like a sprite wine spritzer. If anything this was a prosecco and certainly not anything we were expecting or craving. Fortunately the food helped make up for the wine debacle. The menu is expansive and the specials are creative Italian. The antipasto was impressive while the white wine sauce over grouper was well done.,2,3,4,3,Dined on June 17 2012

GSKS,Toronto,9 reviews,"In one word ""overpriced"". Food quality was good and service was pleasant and attentive but the value for dollar was not there. Given the atmosphere and complexity of dishes your money is better spent at some of the finer restaurants in the city as this restaurant will cost you about just as much. Wine list is also quite limited.",2,3,3,2,Dined on February 15 2012

OpenTable Diner,New York City,2 reviews,The rudest restaurant I have ever visited. The Maitre'd sat two couples ahead of us who did not have a reservation despite the fact that I had one through Open Table. Then sitting at the bar and waiting the bar tender serves others who walk up after me...and trust me it's a small bar and I was the only one standing there until the other two folks showed up. Then a bus boy tries to take my wife purse from a sofa we were sitting at next to the bar. He tells me he thought someone had left it...I was sitting right there! We left. Terrible terrible experience.,1,1,1,1,Dined on January 8 2012

DebM,Denver,4 reviews,This restaurant was obviously trying to accomodate everyone that they could during the Christmas holidays. Unfortunately that made for a very chaotic atmosphere. Besides the noise simply from so many conversations there was some other background noise either from the restaurant sound system or from a child's toy that was loud and annoying. The wait staff was actually running from place to place. We were fed but that's about all I can say.,3,4,2,2,Dined on December 29 2011

The best meatball EVER - you must ask for it as it does not appear on the menu. They pay attention to you but don't hover. View of inside square is a throwback to old NYC.

merylf,New York City,20 reviews,I have been to Il Cortile many times but not in the past several years. I was told by someone who recently dined there that it was not as good as it had been in the past. I would have to agree. I found the food to be no better than average.Also we had a reservation but still waited almost an hour for a table. We were a party of 6 (with a young child)and there was an open table for 6 people next to the table where they wanted to put us. They refused to let us take the other table. It sat empty. They had an 8:00 reservation for that table but the party wasn't there yet and they could have given them our table. It was not a great way to start. They should have apologized and offered a drink appetizer or something.,2,2,2,3,Dined on December 18 2011

Held at door for approx 20-30 mins with no-one really giving any info simply passing by saying give me a few more minutes. Then taken to mezzanine level without this being explained as this was just a 'holding area' whilst further wait for table.

YankeeFred,New York City,20 reviews,this once fine restaurant has seen better days. Now it is surviving on the memories of better times---but still charging first class prices. Service on a not busy night was inattentive. The food was pedestrian with undercooked pasta and bland favorings. A spaghetti puttanesca normally a dish filled with spices left me yearning for a hint of taste. It was a very disappointing experience and one that will not be repeated.

This place has devolved into a tourist trap with waiters who have complete disregard for the customers -- underscored by an intermidable wait for mediocre food. We ordered second glasses of wine that never arrived waited for an eternity between courses were never asked ""how is everything"" and realized that all of the tables around us were also being ignored.

When I wanted to catch up with my best friend I decided Little Italy was the perfect place and Il Cortile is the perfect location to dine. My best friend immediately fell in love with the place. I'm so glad I returned. We shared two appetizers the seafood salad and the Gamberi Fritte “Cortile”. For main courses I had the Fettuccine di Parma and she had the Spaghettini Puttanesca Speciali. For dessert we had the Tiramisu of course. I can't wait to go back. Everything was fresh and flavorful.

OpenTable Diner,Dallas,8 reviews,My girlfriend really wanted to go to Little Italy for dinner and this seemed to be one of the highest rated places. As we walked through Little Italy and approached Il Cortile it did give an impression of being a step above the others. From an ambiance standpoint once inside it is a little dated and tired. It gives the air of a place that was once the place to be and now is kind of resting on its laurels. The service was great and our waiter was very attentive and friendly. The food was average. Overall we wern't too impressed. I would suggest not eating in Little Italy at all after our experience and just going there for dessert after to experience it.,4,3,4,3,Dined on June 18 2011

My husband loved his veal parm as well.However I would have liked to have seen a bottle of champagne for under $140 it seemed a bit excessive.
